All functions have been implemented according to the rubric.
Controls are the same as the rubric.

Spot light feature has been added, with the following control additions:
's' : toggle spotlight
'a' : increase angle of spotlight
'A' : decrease angle of spotlight
't' : increase alpha of spotlight
'T' : decrease alpha of spotlight
'r' : reset all lights

The project is built using CMake. Download all files into a project folder, say "project_dir", and designate that folder as the source directory. Then designate the build directory as "project_dir/build".
